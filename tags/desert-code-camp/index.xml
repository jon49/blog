      <description>Desert Code Camp 2017 was yesterday. I was slated to give four presentations yesterday. I ended up giving three.
Three of them were on F#. I did Introduction to F# in the morning and had two more ready to go in the evening. But by that time everyone in the morning had already gone home, I&amp;rsquo;m guessing, and so the evening attendees probably would have enjoyed hearing Introduction to F# again!</description>
