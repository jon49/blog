      <description>Originally when I was planning on doing a post for the F# Advent Calendar I was thinking I would do one on a tool I&amp;rsquo;m building for C# in F# that mimicks some of the functionality of the fantastic library FSharp.Data.SqlClient. But then I was thinking, &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ve been messing around with F# for a while and have done some production work with it; why not share some of the experiences that I have had with F#?</description>
