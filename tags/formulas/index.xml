      <description>Chandoo had some posts on speeding up Excel worksheets, one of the posts focuses on formulas and another he let the general readers make their suggestions. I made the suggestion that people use array formulas. But most of the other suggestions said not to use array formulas since they slow down your spreadsheet. Needless to say, I was a bit confused, I have seen quite the performance boost from using array formulas.</description>
