      <description>When I was doing some programming in VB.NET (for the Time Stamp program), I tried putting a modeless form in Excel. It came up as a new window in the task bar but then wouldn&amp;rsquo;t actually show on the screen. When I did a modal form it would show on the screen but also in the task bar.
.NET let&amp;rsquo;s you choose the parent window of your form. I found some code on StackOverflow in C# that gives you the proper owner window in IWin32Window form.</description>
