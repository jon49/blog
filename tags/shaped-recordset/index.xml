      <description>Here&amp;rsquo;s some fun code that I worked on a while back. This disconnected record set is what you call a shaped record set, created on the fly. It is a pretty complex class all wrapped in one nice little bundle. Unfortunately it goes terribly slow. Creating a class with the dictionary object in the Scripting Runtime Object Library should be the fastest, if you&amp;rsquo;re looking for speed.
Pretty crazy looking code, but pretty elegant once you get used to looking at code like that, unfortunately it&amp;rsquo;s not very using for creating classes on the fly, or even instead of regular classes (It would make making classes a synch!</description>
