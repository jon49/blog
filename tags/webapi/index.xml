      <description>I presented at the 2016 Desert Code Camp. The topic was WebAPI with F#. I also did a video series to go along with the talk. The talk and video series basically goes over how to use F# in a functional manner by building out all the pieces from scratch.
Here&amp;rsquo;s the series, hope you enjoy it!

Some set up steps and notes that are important to the success of the project:</description>

      <description>The full code for this article is up on GitHub.
I like to the keep things as simple as possible and, ideally, reusable. At my previous employment I came up with a method of validation, but I was never entirely happy with the results. Some of the code repeated itself, and it was difficult to extend to arrays and array comparison. So, I went back to the drawing board building on top of the ideas that I created with the first validation library I created.</description>
