      <description>When I originally created the Excel time card dashboard I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to back my data with any pivot tables. I soon found though that it slowed the calculations so much that I needed to use pivot tables just to make it bearable to work with the dashboard. The reason I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to use pivot tables was because they are prone to do wacky and unexpected things.
So, what I have done is I automated some of the code to fix errors (like make sure that the &amp;ldquo;wksPivotTable&amp;rdquo; has a column for months and years and that it is in order).</description>
