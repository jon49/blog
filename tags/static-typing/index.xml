      <description>From what I understand static typing makes programmers more productive and gives implicit documentation to the code base - although explicit documentation is also very helpful. It also seems to make the tools we use much more powerful.
One of the problems of static typing is that your code becomes more verbose. With programming languages like F# the compiler will implicitly type as much of your program as possible. Where it fails, you need to type it yourself.</description>
