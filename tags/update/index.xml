      <description>Just a quick update. I should be putting out the new Excel Time Card by the end of this week or early next week. This will be a big update. Including the following:
 Dashboard redesign (and Staging Area)  easily change jobs on chart easily change settings on dashboard filter jobs on chart, e.g., you have TimeCard and TimeCard:Marketing, you can just put TimeCard* to include both on the same screen  The template is now included in the program, so no need to download it  I&#39;m testing out a new updater so you can have secure and smaller packaged updates.</description>
