      <description>Now that SQL Server is working better with JSON it is becoming easier to just put plain JSON into columns. It&amp;rsquo;s nice to be able to query the JSON directly in the database. The other day I was wanted to get a list of values in arrays. Here&amp;rsquo;s how I did it.

      <description>There are two different ways people like to write their SQL scripts when calling the database. One way is to write the SQL statements in their application code. Sometimes they will write an ORM to make this process similar to their language constructs. Sometimes they will write the SQL code directly in procedures.
Pros and Cons of Developing in the Application  Pros
 Low friction between application and database.</description>
