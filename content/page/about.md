Father of four who enjoys, backpacking, reading, and programming.

I enjoy functional programming and am currently doing mostly F# with ASP.NET WebAPI with some ASP.NET MVC and front end programming (JavaScript/HTML/CSS).

I was doing node.js with MongoDB but found F# to a great language to work with in a .NET shop. So I ported it back to .NET platform.
