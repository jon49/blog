## Introduction

In this series I'm going to explore MPAs and how to make them better without
going down the full SPA route. How to make web apps simply but have the full
power of an SPA without its complexity.

## What is an MPA

An MPA is a _Multiple web page application_. MPAs serve their content from a
server and render HTML on the front end. Each page performs a single domain
function. When a form is submitted then the whole page is refreshed or an
`iframe` is updated using native HTML.

## What is an SPA

SPAs will combine multiple domains and have a singe user experience across
multiple pages on a website. The page transitions will be more polished. Some
data might be cached.

## Comparison

 MPA              | SPA
------------------|------------------
 Great first load | Slow first load time
------------------|------------------
 Works well for screen readers | Requires extra care for screen readers
------------------|------------------
 Janky page transitions | Smooth page transitions
------------------|------------------
 Easy to program in your favority programming language | Can be difficult as keeping track of state on the front end gets complicated
------------------|------------------
 Low memory usage | high memory usage
------------------|------------------
 Low CPU | Higher CPU usage
------------------|------------------
 Good for low-end devices | Can be bad for low-end devices
------------------|------------------
 Tracking client state is difficult | Tracking client state is simplified
------------------|------------------
 SEO is simple | SEO is difficult, it might require back end static rendering
------------------|------------------
 Navigation can be simpler | Navigation can be made complex
------------------|------------------
 Business rules live on the back end | Business rules can be exposed on the front end
------------------|------------------
 Permissions for data are easier to not expose unauthorized information | If not extremely careful unauthorized data can be exposed in the clien in `JSON` objects
------------------|------------------
 Second renders can be slow | Second renders are normally fast
------------------|------------------
 Mobile development doesn't allow for code reuse | Mobile development may reuse some of the code
------------------|------------------
 Can be used without JavaScript | Requires JavaScript to be enabled
------------------|------------------
 More secure | Less secure unless the developers are very careful
------------------|------------------
 No memory leaks | Memory leaks are possible
------------------|------------------
 No need to handle history - the browser does it! | Handle back and forward can be really complex and difficult problem to solve.
------------------|------------------
 No need to reimplement browser constructs | You need to reimplement built-in browser technology, like history, go back to same spot on page when opening page after browser was closed, etc.
