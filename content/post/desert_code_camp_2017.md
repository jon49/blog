Desert Code Camp 2017 was yesterday. I was slated to give four presentations
yesterday. I ended up giving three.

Three of them were on F#. I did *Introduction to F#* in the morning and had two
more ready to go in the evening. But by that time everyone in the morning had
already gone home, I'm guessing, and so the evening attendees probably would
have enjoyed hearing *Introduction to F#* again!

Below are the links to all the presentations and resources.

### Introduction To F#

> Learn the basic ins and outs of F#! With a focus on syntax and basic
> functional programming concepts.
