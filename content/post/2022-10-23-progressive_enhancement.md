The idea behind progressive enhancement is that you start with a web page which
doesn't require any JavaScript, and for that matter, CSS, and you enhance the
page depending on what the browser allows on the user's device. This allows
older devices to continue to use the web and saves on people's resources as
they no longer need to update their devices in order to keep up with the modern
web.

Progressive enhancement typically has a focus more on the content of the page
rather than the bling of the internet.

A great book on the topic is _Adaptive Web Design: Crafting Rich Experiences
with Progressive Enhancement_ by Aaron Gustafson.
