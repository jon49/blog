&lt;h3 id=&#34;personal&#34;&gt;Personal&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Father of four who enjoys, backpacking, reading, and programming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;work-in-a-nutshell&#34;&gt;Work in a Nutshell&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I enjoy functional programming and am currently doing mostly F# with ASP.NET
WebAPI (RESTful API), with SQL Server and also some ASP.NET MVC and front end
programming (JavaScript/HTML/CSS).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was doing node.js with MongoDB but found F# to a great language to work with
in a .NET shop. So I ported it back to .NET platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.google.com/document/d/14KSYBndNxDSWHhrwrGgmeahqaUvo4MVDWgKsKqp6mWc/edit?usp=sharing&#34;&gt;See my full
resume.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;my-programming-story&#34;&gt;My Programming Story&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I dabbled with programming as a kid and took a class in grade school. Took a
couple classes in college. But didn&amp;rsquo;t really fully get into programming until I
had an engineering position where I would automate part of my job in Excel VBA.
After leaving that company I embarked on my own creating Excel add-ins. I
started with just VBA but soon worked my way into the .NET world with ExcelDNA
using VB.NET, C#, and finally F#.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had one part time consulting position where I created a heat map in Excel
with VBA. As far as I know they are still working with it today. It should have
been built in JavaScript, but it was pretty amazing seeing the power of Excel
and how well it worked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it was time for a full time position I started learning
JavaScript/HTML/CSS. After a while I joined a programming boot camp where I
learned full stack programming with PHP. I found a position where I am
currently at doing Node.js and MongoDB along with .NET and SQL Server with some
front end programming. After using Node.js for about nine months I decided to
move it back .NET.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I&amp;rsquo;m working with WebAPI mostly in F# and I do C# ASP.NET MVC along with
some front end programming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;¡It&amp;rsquo;s about the code, chè!&lt;/p&gt;
