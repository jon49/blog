      <description>Swagger has a definite idea of what makes a good URL. But if you want to do anything outside of that good luck. I think, that even though it seems like a good idea to push people towards a standard it doesn&amp;rsquo;t allow the user to really create RESTful APIs which suit their own needs.
Let&amp;rsquo;s say that you have a reports resource. Sometimes you would like to get the JSON data of the report.</description>
