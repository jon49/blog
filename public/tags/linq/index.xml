      <description>I came across some nice libraries to use while programming to query Excel. Right now Iâ€™m am using the standard COM interface for my projects, which is fine for small ranges (which is true for most users â€“ I would assume). But for large ranges I would need something more powerful.
LinqToExcel
LinqToExcel appears to be a great project for using a Linq interface to query Excel (but not write to Excel).</description>

      <description>Another thing that I like about programming in VB.NET beyond Extensions is LINQ. LINQ is similar to SQL in structure - which is &amp;ldquo;a declarative programming paradigm that expresses the logic of a computation without describing its control flow.&amp;rdquo; So LINQ takes declarative paradigm and applies it to object oriented programming.
What&amp;rsquo;s so great about this? Well, it does slow the program down, but it speeds up the the programming process, puts the information in a form that is more descriptive (although that is no excuse not to thoroughly comment your code), and makes programming easier.</description>
