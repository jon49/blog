      <description>I got the sale software all installed so I can sell the Scribble Filter. Thereâ€™s still a few changes I wanted to make with it. I wasnâ€™t entirely thinking when I added the ability to filter ranges directly when I add (among others). I should have made it more compliant to what Microsoft does. Iâ€™ll be working on changing that around now. It will probably be a little while before I incorporate all of that into the filter.</description>
