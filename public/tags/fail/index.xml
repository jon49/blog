      <description>I used Ron de Bruin&amp;rsquo;s file zipping (and sending) code with Excel. It works great with a few tweaks. Unfortunately when someone is using a USB drive with their workbook on it it fails to work. So warning: Make sure the users are using it on the main computer when trouble shooting!</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on switching over to a &amp;ldquo;new&amp;rdquo; machine (more on that in a new post). In the process my time card program stopped working with the following error:
System.AccessViolationException was unhandled Message: Attempted to read or write protected memory. This is often an indication that other memory is corrupt. Unfortunately this error doesn&amp;rsquo;t show up until well after it occurs. So you need to make some educated guesses as to where it is coming from.</description>

      <description>Copying and pasting is great for coding, but sometimes it can be pretty silly if you make a mistake in the code. Hereâ€™s a triple copy/paste fail (the values should be set to true):
Public Sub SheetActivate_Dashboard(ByVal sh As Object) Try gXLApp.EnableEvents = False OpenTimeStamp() Finally gXLApp.EnableEvents = False End Try End Sub Public Sub SheetDeActivate_Dashboard(ByVal sh As Object) Try gXLApp.EnableEvents = False If Not gfTimeStamp Is Nothing Then gfTimeStamp.Visible = False gfTimeStamp.</description>
