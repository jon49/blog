      <description>When it comes to gardening, I have a black thumb. But every year I try as I might to garden again. Last year I tried mixing some wood and branches into my square boxes inspired from the hugelkultur bed design. This seemed to have a positive effect on my garden and helped it retain water better.
So this year, I&amp;rsquo;m at it again, but on a bigger scale.

8 feet by 4 feet wide by 3 feet deep pit for wood.</description>
