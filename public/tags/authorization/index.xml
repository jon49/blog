      <description>One thing that really got me frustrated in WebAPI 2.0 was creating custom authentication. Eventually I found a blog post by Rick Strahl that showed how to roll your own authentication/authorization. I wanted to implement a login (Basic Authentication) with username/password that would return a token for later (Bearer Authorization) use. It was quite simple but really frustrating because there wasn&amp;rsquo;t a whole lot of documentation on the subject.
Now I want to do something similar for ASP.</description>
