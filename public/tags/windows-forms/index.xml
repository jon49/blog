      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on switching over to a &amp;ldquo;new&amp;rdquo; machine (more on that in a new post). In the process my time card program stopped working with the following error:
System.AccessViolationException was unhandled Message: Attempted to read or write protected memory. This is often an indication that other memory is corrupt. Unfortunately this error doesn&amp;rsquo;t show up until well after it occurs. So you need to make some educated guesses as to where it is coming from.</description>
