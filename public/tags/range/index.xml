      <description>Sometimes, before I realize it (and, Iâ€™m sure, others too) I do a bunch of work, that turns out that I didnâ€™t need to do before. The RangeAddress function that I created is a perfect example of this. This function goes from a column number to a letter and returns the whole string range address. I started off with someones elseâ€™s code. I then made it work for me. Their code only worked for Excel 2003 and below.</description>

      <description>Before I created a quite elaborate code to get the column letter from the column numbers. It turns out that it was much easier than I had thought before. So in the code below Iâ€™ve simplified it considerably by using the Cells method.
In the function below I use a function called FindEnd.
